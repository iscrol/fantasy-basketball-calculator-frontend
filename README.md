Here is the link to the website: https://fantasy-basketball-calculator.netlify.app/.

This is a full stack fantasy basketball calculator that I built to help me with drafting
players for my fantasy basketball team. I created the frontend with React.js and am hosting
it with netlify. I used the python framework Flask for the backend and hosted the
flask app on Heroku. Lastly, I used PostgresQL for the database and am hosting it on
Supabase. I used this calculator to win my fantasy basketball calculator last season!

If needed there's a help button on the site, which gives a detailed explanation on how
to use the site. In fantasy basketball you go head to head against a new opponent each week.
There are 9 statistical categories that you compete against your opponent in. You win the
weekly matchup by winning more of the 9 categories than your opponent. So, in order to
guarantee a win you only need to win 5 of the categories. As a result, there is a very
common strategy called punting where a player disregards a couple of categories
and drafts a team that is designed to only be good at 5-7 categories since you don't
need to be good at all of them. This is where my calculator comes into play. There
are lots of rankings on the internet for players where all 9 categories are included;
however, the value of a player changes dramatically dependeing on what categories you
include/exclude. My calculator allows you to specifiy your exact strategy and will
generate a ranking of players based off of this strategy. This can give you a competitive
advantage in your draft or waiver wire pickups as you can draft players that are highly
valued for your strategy, but may not be valued as highly overall. I was able to utilize
this tool and technique to win my fantasy basketball league last season, so the calculator
does have some merit to it.
